Baudelaire, with his seminal work \"Les Fleurs du Mal,\" transcends traditional genre boundaries, rendering him indeed unclassifiable within a singular literary category. \n\nDrawing upon the meticulous analysis of renowned literary critics and scholars, it becomes evident that Baudelaire's oeuvre defies simplistic categorization due to its multifaceted nature that intertwines elements of Romanticism, Symbolism, and Modernism. His innovative blending of themes, styles, and structures challenges conventional genre distinctions, thereby positioning him as a literary figure who exists beyond the confines of a singular classification.\n\nIn light of the complexity and richness of Baudelaire's artistic expression, it becomes apparent that attempting to confine his work within a specific genre would be a reductionist oversimplification. Therefore, I invite my esteemed counterparts to engage in a thoughtful exploration of how Baudelaire's literary legacy eludes rigid categorization and beckons us to embrace the beauty of ambiguity and complexity in artistic creation.",
